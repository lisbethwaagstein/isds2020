      <description>Guide to preparations It is necessary that you time preparing for the course. We expect that you have spent up 50 hours on learning basic Python and pandas before we begin teaching, depending on your prior experience. In particular you should do the following (prioritized order):
 Install anaconda and other software Open Assignment 0 in Jupyter notebook, see this guide on how to open and use a notebook Work on Assignment 0 - try to solve as much as possible When you get stuck then follow the trouble shooting guideline below - start with a) and move to d)  Assignment 0 In preparation for the course you are expected to hand in an assignment in Python before lectures begin.</description>
